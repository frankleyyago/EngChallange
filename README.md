EngBIMChallange
This repository contains the solution to the ENG BIM technical challenge. The add-in for Revit was developed based on the provided requirements to showcase my skills in Revit API and C#.

Project Overview
The add-in is designed to identify and manipulate Revit elements based on specific parameters, allowing for operations such as element selection and isolation by parameter names and values.

Features
Parameter-Based Selection: Select elements based on specified parameters (e.g., "Comments").
View Isolation: Isolate selected elements within the active view.
UI Controls: Easy-to-use WPF UI for parameter input and operation execution.
Compatibility
The add-in was developed using a different Revit version due to availability constraints. The demonstration in the linked video confirms functionality and provides a detailed walkthrough of the add-in's operations.

Usage Instructions
Clone this repository.
Open the project in Visual Studio.
Build and deploy the add-in to Revit by adding the .addin file to Revit's AddIns folder.
Launch Revit, open a model, and use the add-inâ€™s UI to test parameter-based functions.
Video Demonstration
For a full demonstration of the add-in, watch the video: ENG BIM Add-in Demo

Source Code
The source code for this add-in is available in this repository for further examination and testing.
